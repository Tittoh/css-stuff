# Introduction
 
Welcome to my dungeon of CSS stuff I find interesting.

## About

Whenever I find something that looks cool, I break it down, recreate it and post the snippets here. 
These include JavaScript functions, styled components and anything else. 

## Tech
This project was reated using:
- [Nextra](https://nextra.site) - Simple, powerful and flexible markdown-powered docs site.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - The React Framework for the Web
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes.
- [Code Hike](https://codehike.org) - A remark plugin for MDX to display code on websites.
- TypeScript - Used to ceate components.
- CSS - Styling the components individually.
